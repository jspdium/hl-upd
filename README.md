## Motivation: who verifies the verifiers? 
    
*  More and more, new formalisms and verification techniques are expected to be formalized, and meta-properties proved with a proof assistant or similar tool (and made available to the community)
    
*  General programme: given a programming language and a program logic for that language, we aim to 
   - Prove soundness and (some notion of) completeness of the logic w.r.t to the programming language semantics 
   - Write a Verification Conditions Generator for the logic: an algorithm that, given a program and a specification, outputs a set of first-order proof obligations
   - Prove soundness and completeness of the VCGen


*  Why3: a sweet spot, in terms of expressivity of logic language, degree of automation, and proof management, for formalizing  different notions involved in program verification 

*  As a case study, we consider a non-standard version of Hoare logic for While programs, based on the notion of update (a notion which is also used in the JavaDL logic of the KeY tool)

*  Even though the programming language is simple, the formalization of updates is quite intricate!



## Results 


* fully automatic proofs of soundness and completeness 
        (in the sense that no goals have to be discharged with the help
        of an interactive proof assistant -- however, some internal
        proof trasnformations are required) 
        
* a proved VCGen
  * The VCGen is a WhyML program, so its proofs of soundness and completeness are obtained at program-level, not logic
  * It is extractable using Why3â€™s extraction mechanism, into OCaml
  * It produces FOL proof obligations, so it is compatible with the use of SMT solvers



## Why3 version

* version 1.2.0 was used for this development
